# US-States---Hexbins
US State features in a uniform Hexbin/hexagonal shape.

Unless the file name indicates otherwise, the projection is US National Atlas Equal Area, EPSG: 2163. The KML has a WGS84 Web Mercator spatial reference, and one version of the shapefile is also posted with that SR.

Additional file formats will be uploaded when I have time

Suggestions appreciated
